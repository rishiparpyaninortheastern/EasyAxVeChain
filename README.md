Problem Statement 🚫

As the global travel industry burgeons, its environmental impact remains a significant concern. Many travelers wish to reduce their carbon footprint but lack the resources and knowledge to make informed choices. Existing platforms don't prioritize or reward eco-friendly decisions.
<b>

Facts 📊
Tourism contributes to nearly 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Eco-lodgings, on average, consume 20% less water than traditional hotels.
